				<h3>Pagsamo</h3>
				<p> Arthur Nery</p>	<br>

				<p>Kung bibitaw nang mahinahon ako ba'y lulubayan ng ating</p>
				<p>Mga kahapon na 'di na kayang ayusin ng lambing </p>
				<p> Mga pangako ba'y sapat na upang muli tayong ipagtagpo ng hinaharap</p>	
				<p>Ba't pa ipapaalala 'di rin naman panghahawakan ba't pa ipipilit kung 'di naman tayo ang (kung di naman)</p><br>

				<p>Para sa isa't-isa oh 'di ba sinta tayong dalawa lang noon</p>
				<p>Para sa isa't-isa oh ba't 'di sumang-ayon sa 'tin ang panahon</p> <br>

				<p>Siguro nga'y wala nang natira sa mga sinulat mo na para sa 'kin</p>
				<p>Alam kong luha ang bumubura ngunit hayaan mo na lang</p>
				<p>Walang saysay ang panalangin ko kung 'di ako ang hahanapin mo</p>
				<p>Kahit sigaw pa ang pagsamo ko sa 'yo bakit 'di mo dama 'to</p>
				<p>Ba't pa ipapaalala 'di rin naman panghahawakan ba't pa ipipilit kung 'di naman tayo ang (kung di naman)</p> <br>

				<p>Para sa isa't-isa oh ba't 'di sumang-ayon sa 'tin ang panahon</p>
				<p>Para sa isa't-isa oh 'di ba sinta tayong dalawa lang noon</p>
				<p>Para sa isa't-isa ba't 'di sumang-ayon sa 'tin ang panahon</p>

				<h3>Echanted</h3>
				<p>Taylor Swift</p> <br>

				<p>There I was again tonight</p>
				<p>Forcing laughter, faking smiles</p>
				<p>Same old tired, lonely place</p>
				<p>Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy</p>
				<p>Vanished when I saw your face</p>
				<p>All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you</p> <br>

				<p>Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"</p>
				<p>Cross the room your silhouette</p>
				<p>Starts to make its way to me</p>
				<p>The playful conversation starts</p>
				<p>Counter all your quick remarks</p>
				<p>Like passing notes in secrecy</p><br>

				<p>And it was enchanting to meet you</p>
				<p>All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you</p>
				<p>This night is sparkling, don't you let it go</p>
				<p>I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home</p>
				<p>I'll spend forever wondering if you knew</p>
				<p>I was enchanted to meet you</p> <br>

				<p>The lingering question kept me up</p>
				<p>2 AM, who do you love?</p>
				<p>I wonder 'til I'm wide awake</p>
				<p>And now I'm pacing back and forth</p>
				<p>Wishing you were at my door</p>
				<p>I'd open up and you would say, "Hey"</p><br>

				<p>It was enchanting to meet you</p>
				<p>All I know is, I was enchanted to meet you</p><br>

				<p>This night is sparkling, don't you let it go</p>
				<p>I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home</p>
				<p>I'll spend forever wondering if you knew</p>
				<p>That this night is flawless, don't you let it go</p>
				<p>I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone</p>
				<p>I'll spend forever wondering if you knew</p>
				<p>I was enchanted to meet you</p><br>

				<p>This is me praying that</p>
				<p>This was the very first page</p>
				<p>Not where the story line ends</p>
				<p>My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again</p>
				<p>These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon</p>
				<p>I was enchanted to meet you</p>
				<p>Please don't be in love with someone else</p>
				<p>Please don't have somebody waiting on you</p>
				<p>Please don't be in love with someone else</p>
				<p>Please don't have somebody waiting on you</p><br>

				<p>This night is sparkling, don't you let it go</p>
				<p>I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home</p>
				<p>I'll spend forever wondering if you knew</p>
				<p>This night is flawless, don't you let it go</p>
				<p>I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone</p>
				<p>I'll spend forever wondering if you knew</p>
				<p>I was enchanted to meet you</p><br>

				<p>Please don't be in love with someone else</p>
				<p>Please don't have somebody waiting on you</p>

				<h3>Easy On Me</h3>
				<p>Adele</p><br>

				<p>There ain't no gold in this river</p>	
				<p>That I've been washin' my hands in forever</p>
				<p>I know there is hope in these waters</p>	
				<p>But I can't bring myself to swim</p>
				<p>When I am drowning in this silence</p>
				<p>Baby, let me in</p><br>

				<p>Go easy on me, baby</p>	
				<p>I was still a child</p>
				<p>Didn't get the chance to</p>	
				<p>Feel the world around me</p>
				<p>I had no time to choose</p>
				<p>What I chose to do</p>
				<p>So go easy on me</p><br>

				<p>There ain't no room for things to change</p>	
				<p>When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways</p>
				<p>You can't deny how hard I have tried</p>	
				<p>I changed who I was to put you both first</p>
				<p>But now I give up</p><br>

				<p>Go easy on me, baby</p>	
				<p>I was still a child</p>	
				<p>Didn't get the chance to</p>
				<p>Feel the world around me</p>	
				<p>Had no time to choose</p>
				<p>What I chose to do</p>
				<p>So go easy on me</p>	<br>

				<p>I had good intentions</p>	
				<p>And the highest hopes</p>
				<p>But I know right now</p>	
				<p>That probably doesn't even show</p><br>

				<p>Go easy on me, baby</p>
				<p>I was still a child</p>	
				<p>I didn't get the chance to</p>	
				<p>Feel the world around me</p>
				<p>I had no time to choose</p>	
				<p>What I chose to do</p>
				<p>So go easy on me</p>
